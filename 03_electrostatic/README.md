### 3. **ELECTROSTATIC**

At the beginning of this section, the electron density and the electrostatic potential obtained from the calculation are extracted.
By performing the planar average, the density profile in particular direction can be obtained.
We will see that the electrostatic potential of the non-zero dipole system under periodic treatment is difficult to define and diverged.
Here, we are provided with two methods to treat the dipole;
(I) the dipole correction in a recipe of _[L. Bengtsson, PRB 59, 12301 (1999)]_
and (II) the open boundary recipe of _[M. Otani and O. Sugino, PRB 73, 115407 (2006)]_

1) charge density and electrostatic potential
2) work function 
3) Dipole correction (slab)
4) Constant electric field (sawtooth potential)
5) Bias potential using ESM (Effective Screening Medium)
- Isolated slab (vacuum/slab/vacuum)
- Slab under an electric field (metal/slab/metal)
- Charged slab (vacuum/slab/metal)
