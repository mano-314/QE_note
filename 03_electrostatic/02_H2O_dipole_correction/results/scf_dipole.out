     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field

 
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      16
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
