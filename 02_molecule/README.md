### 2. **MOLECULE**

In the study of electrochemical system, the calculations involving the isolated molecule (or isolated system/ 2D) are required.
Moreover, the calculation of vibrational properties is very important in determining the ZPE, entropy and so on.
In this section, we will look at how to simulate the isolated molecule as well as the vibrational frequencies using
two different approaches; density functional purterbation theory (DFPT) and the finite displacement (FD) method.
For FD, which is not directly implemented in QE, the external tools (ASE and Phonopy) are introduced here.
Next, the calculation of the atomic charge in Bader scheme will be introduced.

1) optimization
2) vibration (DFPT)
3) vibration (FD-ase)
4) vibration (FD-phonopy)
5) atomic charge (Bader and Lowdin)
