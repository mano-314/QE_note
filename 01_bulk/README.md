### 1. **BULK**

QE was developed based on plane wave representation for solving KS-equation.
It was fitted for the calculation in solid states, which is the original spirit of QE.
We will start from looking at the representative properties; band structures and density of states

1) optimization
2) bandstructure
3) dos
